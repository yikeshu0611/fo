Description: File operation is useful and important skills in R. 'fo' package 
    make it easy for us to do this.
        If you want to look for some kinds of file or directory. list_doc(), 
    list_xlsx(), list_xls(), list_txt(), list_pdf(), list_png(), list_jpg(), 
    list_tif(), list_tiff(), list_exe(), list_R(), list_dir() will help you to 
    look for all files or directory by your path. Functions ended with 2 can 
    look for sub-directory files.
        If you want to seek the latest file in your path, functions, lastest_a(), 
    lastest_m(), lastest_c(), will help you to seek that file by access time, 
    modify time and change time.
        If you want to copy, cut, delete or rename files, functions, copy(), cut_file(), 
    delete(), rename() will help to finish that.
